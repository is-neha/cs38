  "answer": "VINS is structured as four phases. Each one is marked by a badge — a small token of where you are in the journey.\n🥉Bronze (Phase 1)— a short training period at the start, planned\naround what you already know. If you arrive already comfortable with the   basics, your mentor may skip Bronze and put you straight on to the project.\n🥈Silver (Phase 2)— the main work. You contribute to a real\nopen-source project under a Vicharanashala mentor. Finishing Bronze and   Silver completes your internship and earns the certificate.\n🥇Gold (Phase 3)— a recognition awarded during Silver if your\ncontribution stands on its own as a meaningful feature, not just a small   fix.\n🏆Platinum (Phase 4)— a standing invitation to come back and visit\nthe lab — a short trip — any time during the year after your internship   ends. We help with travel through a small visit stipend.\nMost interns finish at Bronze + Silver, and that is exactly what the certificate is for. Gold and Platinum are extras you can pick up if your work makes the case for them. Either way, you walk away with a real open-source contribution to your name and a mentor who knows you well."

  "answer": "You can start any time in 2026 — VINS is flexible on the start date —but there are two things you must hold in mind together, and one strong recommendation.\nThe hard rule.Your internship mustfinish by 31 December 2026.That date is non-negotiable. Whatever start you pick, your end date (your start + 2 months, with up to 1 month grace) must land on or before 31 December 2026. So while there is no last date toopt in, there is absolutely a last date tofinish.\nThe strong recommendation: start as soon as possible.The earlier you join, the more of the May–July main cohort you catch — and three things make starting earlier materially better than starting later:\nCohort networking.The batch goes through Bronze together —\npeer discussions, parallel problem-solving, and lasting   connections happen during this window. Later in the year the   cohort disperses and late starters are largely solo.\nTA support is concentrated in May–July.TAs are full-time\nduring this window. After this they return to their own college   work and bandwidth is materially thinner.\nTraining rolls out with the cohort, not piecemeal — you get\nthe material with the discussion around it, not as a static   document.\nIf starting now is genuinely impossible for you (exams, other unavoidable commitments), you can begin later and still complete and earn the certificate — but be honest with yourself: the cohort effect and support will be lighter, and the December cap means a late start leaves no room for slippage."

  "question": "Can I start with the cohort and take a relaxation during my exam window?",
>>>>>>> bda541506fe3be453675ab66fd034cae46aa6cb2
  "answer": "No. This is not an arrangement we offer.\nVINS is a full-attention internship — six to ten hours a day, sometimes more. Splitting that with college exams damages both sides: the project loses momentum, the exams suffer, and the mentor invests in someone who can only half-engage. We have seen this fail enough times to be firm.\nIf your exams fall inside the cohort duration, defer your start to after your exams end, opt in then, and run the internship at full attention. The certificate and project pathway are the same.\nA note on consequences.If we later learn that a candidate was sitting college exams during their internship period,we reserve the right to terminate the internship or withhold the certificate at any time— including after the internship has otherwise been completed."

  "answer": "Once you have opted into VINS in the chat with Yaksha (see §4.2), log in to samagama.in. On the dashboard, you will see a yellow card titled\"🗓️ Confirm your internship dates\". The two date pickers pre-fill with sensible defaults for the current cohort. If those work for you, hit \"Save dates\". Otherwise edit them to your earliest realistic start — your end must be on or before31 December 2026.\nA green confirmation appears once saved. You can edit any time from the same card.\nOrder doesn't matter.You can save your datesbefore or afteruploading your NOC — both paths work.\nThe dates you enter must match the internship period your HOD signs off on in your NOC. If you need to change the period later, edit the dates on the same card and upload a fresh NOC matching the new period."

  "answer": "Once your formal offer letter arrives, accepting it has a precise form. Please follow it carefully — the form itself is the first attention-to-detail check of the internship.\nReply All on the offer-letter thread— the email you received fromno-reply@vicharanashala.aialready hassudarshan@iitrpr.ac.inon it; keep that address on your reply. In the body, paste the following acceptance statementexactly as printed, with your full name inserted and a date added:\n> I, [Full Name], confirm that I have read, understood, and accepted > all terms, conditions, and obligations set out in this offer letter > and in the program FAQ at samagama.in. I formally accept the offer > of Summer Internship 2026.\nCopy-paste this sentence as-is.Do not paraphrase, do not shorten, do not rearrange the words. The reply must reach us within5 daysof the offer letter being sent.\nAlternative form— instead of typing the statement, you maydownload the offer letter PDF, fill in your name and the date in the acceptance block, sign and scan as a PDF, and attach that signed file to your reply. An attached signed acceptance counts as a valid reply.\nA few clarifying points (because we've been asked):\nSignature placement on the PDF.If the PDF shows only a \"Date\"\nfield, write your signature next to the date field or directly   below the last line of the acceptance text. Either is acceptable.\nDo not change the recipient fields.Reply on the same email\nthread; do not remove or alter any address that was already there."

  "answer": "The two tracks are finalised at the interview stage, and we do not move candidates between them. VISE has a fixed on-campus capacity planned around mentor bandwidth, hostel availability, and stipend allocation — once the shortlist is set, it stays set. VINS is not a consolation track. The project, the mentor, and the certificate are the same as VISE — what differs is the mode (online) and the absence of a fellowship. Many interns find the online format more effective. Your best path forward is to confirm your VINS start dates and get your NOC uploaded — you're already in a strong position."

>>>>>>> bda541506fe3be453675ab66fd034cae46aa6cb2
  "answer": "Rosetta is your internship journal — a 65-day document, one entry per day, every day, for the full duration of Summership 2026. You write in it daily, keep it privately, and submit it at the end of the internship as one of your completion requirements.\nThe name comes from the Rosetta Stone — discovered in 1799, it carried the same text in three scripts and became the key to decoding an ancient language that had been silent for centuries. Not because it was grand, but because it was honest and consistent. That is what this journal is meant to be for you. Sixty-five days of honest writing will become the key to understanding your own experience — what you learned, where you struggled, what shifted in you."

  "question": "Why does this exist? Is it just busywork?",
>>>>>>> bda541506fe3be453675ab66fd034cae46aa6cb2
  "answer": "No. It exists for two reasons.\nFor you:Most people go through an intense experience and carry it without processing it. They finish and cannot articulate what they actually learned, what changed in them, or what they would do differently. The journal builds that articulation, one day at a time. Students who reflect regularly during a programme consistently get more out of it than those who do not — not because they work harder, but because they understand what they are doing and why.\nFor us:When you submit Rosetta at the end, it gives us qualitative insight into your experience that no survey or evaluation can capture. We use it to understand what worked, what did not, and how to make the programme better for the next cohort. Your honest voice matters to that process."

  "question": "What is a \"thinking routine\"?",
>>>>>>> bda541506fe3be453675ab66fd034cae46aa6cb2
  "answer": "Each day in Rosetta has a thinking routine — a short framework that gives your reflection a specific shape. Instead of staring at a blank page and writing \"today was good,\" the routine gives you a specific lens. Examples:\n3-2-1— 3 things you engaged with, 2 questions on your mind, 1 surprise.Muddy / Clear— what is sharp, and what is still foggy.What? So What? Now What?— separate facts from meaning from action.\nThe routines rotate across the 65 days so the journal does not feel repetitive or mechanical. Some will feel easy. Some will make you stop and actually think. That is the point.\nYou do not need to research the routine or prepare for it. Just read the description at the top of each day's entry and write."

>>>>>>> bda541506fe3be453675ab66fd034cae46aa6cb2
  "answer": "ViBe is built and continuously improved by interns and students themselves. It is a free and open-source learning platform, and our goal is to keep it that way by encouraging the community to actively contribute, improve, and strengthen it rather than bypass it.\nIf a learner strongly feels that the regular ViBe flow does not fairly reflect their understanding, there is a formal alternative evaluation path. However, this path is intentionally rigorous to ensure fairness for everyone.\nIn such cases, you will be asked to:\nWatch the specified YouTube video content completely (links will be provided).Appear for a three-hour proctored examination based only on that content.Write the exam under strict supervision with:Two cameras (front and side view), andOne online human proctor monitoring you live.\nThis examination becomes the sole basis for evaluation in place of the regular internship track.\nThe scoring rules are strict:\nScore below 60%: You are considered not qualified and must join the next cohort and continue only through the normal ViBe mode.Score between 60% and 80%: You get one more chance in the next scheduled exam.Score above 80%: You are considered to have passed.\nThis special exam is conducted once every fortnight, so choosing this route may significantly delay your progress compared to continuing normally on ViBe.\nBecause this path is far more demanding and time-consuming than simply completing the regular videos, quizzes, and activities, most students find that continuing with the standard ViBe workflow is the faster and better option."

If you are on thenth item but haven't completed every video and quiz from item 1 through itemn−1, the platform will show this alert.\nWhen the banner appears, ViBe automaticallyreturns you to the previous valid content— that is, the last item you had legitimately reached in the sequence. You will not lose any progress; you'll simply be sent back to where you actually are in the course.\nIt is the system gently telling you:\"Please check — there is something earlier in the course that you haven't finished yet.\""

  "answer": "No — and this is one of the most important things to understand before reading the rest of this section.\nViBe's proctoring system ismodular. Each individual check — face visibility, single-face-in-frame, lighting, background voices, gaze on screen, camera/microphone access — can beindependently switched on or off by the instructorfor a given course or cohort.\nThis means:\nThe instructor decideswhich proctoring elements are active for their course.Some courses may run withallchecks active (typical for internships, faculty FDPs, and credentialed programmes).Other courses may run withonly a subsetactive — for example, face visibility on but background-voice detection off — depending on the learning context.Certain pilot or open courses may havemost proctoring relaxed, especially where the focus is exploration rather than verified evaluation.\nThe FAQs that follow (12.18 through 12.23) describe thefull set of proctoring behavioursthe platform is capable of. They are written as if everything is switched on. **Whether a specific check applies toyourcourse depends entirely on what your instructor has enabled for that course.**\n⚠️Please do not assume rules carry across courses.A relaxation given in one course (for example, allowing two faces in frame for a paired-learning module) doesnottransfer to another course on the same platform. Always check the course-specific guidelines shared by your instructor or programme team before each course you join.\nWhen in doubt, ask your instructor or programme coordinator which proctoring elements are active for your current course."

  "answer": "While a lesson plays, a small helper runs gently on your device using your camera and microphone. It checks,in real time, that the basic conditions for learning are present.\nSpecifically, it looks at five things:\nA face is visible— to confirm you are really there.Only one face is in frame— to confirm the learning is yours.There is enough light on your face— a silhouette is hard to recognise.The room isn't full of voices— no talking, TV, or background podcasts.You are looking at the screen— brief glances away are fine; long stretches feel like drifting off.\nThe helper is not a judge. Brief, normal movements (a stretch, a sneeze, a glance at your notebook) are absolutely fine. It only pays attention tosustained patterns, not split-second things."

The helper checks that exactly one face is visible at a time.\nGroup study is genuinely a wonderful habit, just not inside a ViBe session itself. A good way to do it:\nHop on a separate call with your friend on your phone or a second device.Discuss concepts before or after a ViBe lesson, not during it.Return to ViBe alone when you're ready to watch the clip and attempt the quiz.\n> 📌Note:As explained in12.17, the single-face-in-frame check is an instructor-controlled setting. A few courses (typically paired-learning or collaborative pilots) may explicitlyrelaxthis rule.Do not assume that relaxation in one course applies to another— even on the same platform with the same login.

Daily consistency beats a five-hour weekend cram.Take breaks between clips, not during them. A clip is short — finish it first.Treat each quiz as a gentle check-in, not a high-stakes test.For programmes with deadlines(such as internships or faculty cohorts), aim for the daily progress target announced by your programme team — typically around 3.33% per day.\n> 📌A note on milestones:The pacing above is ageneral guidelineonly.
